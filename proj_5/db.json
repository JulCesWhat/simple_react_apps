Now serverless is emerging as an even smaller component of the new way of building applications piece by piece.  In our zeal to adopt the latest in architectural approaches, have we given sufficient thought to where they are going or what comes next?\n<br/><br/>\nIf you are considering building an application with a microservice or serverless based architecture, come to this panel of experienced cloud developers and architects and learn what these technologies can do for you now, and what they will do in the future.  Ask our panel questions on what works, what doesn't, and how to prepare today for the technology that's coming next.",
